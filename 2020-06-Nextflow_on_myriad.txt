# current config file is called myriad.config
#  needs to be in current directory

# You also need to make sure you follow the singularity bash options from:
# https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Software_Guides/Singularity/

# Then when you call Nexflow, you must first load the modules:
module load blic-modules nextflow

# Then you can run say the rnaseq pipeline
# use full path to files
nextflow -c myriad.config run nf-core/rnaseq -profile singularity -r 1.4.2 --reads Test_data/read1.fq.gz --fasta genome.fasta --gff species.gff3 -with-report -with-trace -bg --singleEnd


# Once you have Nextflow set up and know how to run things you can also try NF-tower. This is a nice way to tract how a particular pipeline is running


#You need to register here : https://tower.nf/

# Add some lines to your .bashrc on myriad
# Follow the instructions on tower


# Then add this to the nextflow command:
-with-tower


# Then go on https://tower.nf/ to see the job running
